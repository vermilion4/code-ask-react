            Our platform is made for different levels of developers (junior,
            intermediate, senior). The beginner friendly interface we provide
            allows easy navigation of questions and solutions already available
            on the platforms, and also encourage posting of even the most basic
            questions a junior developer might have. <br /> <br />
            Code Ask offers a more robust question and answer platform where
            software developers and programmers can have solutions to their
            problems on a single platform, through the integration of
            StackOverflow, Quora, and Github, thereby saving time and making
            their experience better.
